# Professional Readme Generator


## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a program that builds a skeleton for a professional readme, given some information from the user.

Program runs exclusively in the terminal.

User input processed using [the Inquirer npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

Through this project, I learnt more about Javascript, working with npm, inquirer, and how to ensure a program's logic is as sharp as possible.

## Installation

Ensure that [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed, and that you have access to the relevant terminal on your OS. 
This application was also developed using the [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) terminal, and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the IDE of choice.

## Usage

To use the program, run 'node (insert file pathway to index.js file) in the terminal. You will then be prompted for information regarding the project you wish to build the readme for.

Pressing the 'enter' key on any of the prompts will skip it, creating the relevant section though with no information in it, allowing you to manually add information as you deem fit.

After all prompts have been answered, the readmne and license will be created in the 'results' folder, under the names 'readme.md' and 'license.txt' respectively.
